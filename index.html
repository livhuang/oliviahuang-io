				Hi, my name is Olivia Huang and I am a senior at NYU's Gallatin School of Individualized Study. I am building my own major, concentrating in 
                Software Engineering and Human Behavior. 
                My concentration navigates the intersection of technology and ethics through the academic disciplines of psychology (behavioral sciences), philosophy (ethics & morality), and cultural strategy. 
                I am interested in understanding how the human mind interplays with the condition of society, in order to explore how technology can be utilized in benefiting the collective's needs. 
                I did not want to be a traditional Computer Science major while studying at NYU, because I believe that studying the humanities should coincide with developing technologies of the future 
                that will shape and influence the cultural ethnosphere. Developers should be pmindful of the many ethical implications that are posed by the accelerating trajectory of technology, such as 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Surveillance Capitalism
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Big Data: User privacy & data mining
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Genetic Engineering
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Artificial Intelligence & prediction bias
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        etc.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                Even the rise of social media in the past decade opens discourse to the question: 
                <br>
                <div class = "centerText">
                    <i> Are we losing meaning in humanity to the lack of oversight and responsability in technological evolution?</i>
                </div>
               
                I aspire to renegotiate the realm of software engineering towards ethical parameters & enhance the human condition through things I create.

                Currently, I am working on iOS development for <a href="https://www.whatdazeit.com/">Everydaze</a>, which is an application that incentivizes 
				people to practice daily gratitude. Please find the beta version <a href="https://www.whatdazeit.com/">here</a>. The app has not yet been deployed, 
				as only the web-version is available now. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of software engineering, I like to spend my time playing volleyball, boxing, and doing anything that involves being outside. 
				I feel my best when I am around my friends :)
